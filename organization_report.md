- Undo script generated: undo_organization.sh
- All operations logged to: organization.log
- No files were deleted, only moved

## Current Directory Structure



## Next Steps
1. Review the new structure
2. Update any hardcoded paths in your code
3. Update documentation references
4. Test that all scripts still work from their new locations

## Undo Instructions
If you need to revert the organization, run:
```bash
bash undo_organization.sh
```
