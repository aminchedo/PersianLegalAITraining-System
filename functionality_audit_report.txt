## STRUCTURE VERIFICATION
- Total files (excl. deps/cache): 184
- Python files: 82
- TypeScript files: 50
- JavaScript files: 4
- Lines of code (approx):
  - Python: 28,951
  - TypeScript: 8,973

- Key directories:
  - `backend/`: present
  - `frontend/`: present
  - `data/`: present (`./data`, `./backend/data`)
  - `ai_models/`: missing

- Key files/config:
  - `start_system.py`: missing
  - `docker-compose.yml`: missing (production variant present: `docker-compose.production.yml`)
  - `requirements.txt` (root): missing (found `backend/requirements.txt`)
  - `frontend/package.json`: present
  - `configs/.env.development`: present

## FUNCTIONALITY SCORECARD (0-100%)

### 📁 Project Structure Score
- ✅ Backend directory: +20%
- ✅ Frontend directory: +20%
- ❌ Python dependencies (root requirements.txt): 0%
- ❌ Docker setup (docker-compose.yml): 0%
- ❌ Startup script: 0%

### 🚀 Backend Implementation Score
- ✅ Main application (FastAPI app in `backend/main.py`): +25%
- ✅ FastAPI usage (many refs found): +25%
- ✅ API endpoints (`backend/api/*`, routes in `backend/main.py`): +25%
- ✅ AI frameworks (torch/transformers refs present): +25%

### ⚛️ Frontend Implementation Score
- ✅ React components (Vite React app, many components): +30%
- ✅ Node.js setup (`frontend/package.json`): +20%
- ✅ Dashboard UI (dashboard components and e2e spec): +30%
- ✅ Persian/RTL support (many references): +20%

### 🧪 Testing & Quality Score
- ✅ Python tests exist (many test files): +40%
- ✅ Frontend tests exist (vitest/playwright configs and e2e spec): +30%
- ✅ Test functions (114 Python, 16 JS/TS detected): +30%

## EVIDENCE HIGHLIGHTS
- Backend FastAPI app and endpoints in `backend/main.py`; additional routers under `backend/api/`.
- Frontend Vite React app with `frontend/src/App.tsx`, dashboard components, and `vitest`/`playwright` configs; dependencies not installed (UNMET in `npm ls`).
- AI model code present (DoRA/QR-Adaptor) in `backend/models/` and `models/`.
- No root `requirements.txt`; cannot `pip install` at root. A `backend/requirements.txt` exists.
- No `docker-compose.yml`; `docker-compose.production.yml` present but `docker-compose` not available in the environment to validate.
- `start_system.py` missing.

## 🎯 CRITICAL MISSING COMPONENTS
- ❌ `start_system.py` missing
- ❌ `docker-compose.yml` missing (only production variant present)
- ❌ Root-level `requirements.txt` missing
- ❌ Frontend dependencies not installed

## 🚀 NEXT ACTIONS REQUIRED
1. Add root `requirements.txt` or document using `backend/requirements.txt` with a clear setup sequence.
2. Provide `docker-compose.yml` for development or document using the production compose file.
3. Implement a startup/orchestration script to bring up backend, frontend, and dependencies coherently.
4. Install and lock frontend dependencies; ensure `vite build` succeeds and CI runs.
5. Wire backend endpoints to frontend dashboard and verify end-to-end flows.
6. Configure testing (pytest config, CI, coverage) and run coverage reports to validate the 95% claim.
7. Implement or document real-time WebSocket monitoring if claimed; no explicit WebSocket implementation was verified.

## 📊 HONEST ASSESSMENT
Substantial backend, frontend, models, and tests exist. Packaging, dependency setup, and orchestration are incomplete. As-is, this is not production-ready; it needs integration work, environment standardization, and CI/coverage to meet the stated claims.
